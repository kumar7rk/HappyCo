play around with the sheetjs

//write better code (appfolio example) 
//- continue if website is not available
//- run for all the rows in a column rather than hardcoding the values
//- if empty cell still add information
//- a better for writeCell values


//visit multiple urls hardcoded

//visit multiple urls hardcoded with less/efficient code

//read a cell value from excel

//write company name to column b for the first cell

//add some text in column c and copy website

//check the code ones

//run for the first batch

//linkedin-else not running

Linkedin
//- clean up code
- make changes as per sheetjs library

//Improve LinkedIn code efficiency 
//-current avg. time per user - 8 secs (794/100) Aiming-4 secs
//- avg 5-5.5 sec at work with 4-5 people in office
//-LOC 298 19r9

//don't run anything if profile is deleted and also make a note in excel so we don't keep on visiting them in future

//check if profile unavailable (R) is yes don't even visit url - exit

//test for first 10 accounts only for title
//expand for everthing
test for more accounts

//think of shrinking the write operations as well?
check if str is null exit for now?



check if str is empty - ideally retry or maybe increase wait for or use waitFor selector
if profile private job title e.g https://www.linkedin.com/in/brent-law-49a54053
