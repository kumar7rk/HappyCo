//write better code (appfolio example) 
//- continue if website is not available
//- run for all the rows in a column rather than hardcoding the values

//- a better for writeCell values


//visit multiple urls hardcoded

//visit multiple urls hardcoded with less/efficient code

//read a cell value from excel

//write company name to column b for the first cell
