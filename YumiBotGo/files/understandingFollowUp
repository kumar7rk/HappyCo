users <how to do this>
my message:<hey this is how you do it>
and then they don't reply for a day or two
I'll send them #what's up
and add ### (sometimes)

what if I can do yumi rep follow when I send the message
so the workflow is
yumi rep follow
 snooze for 3 days
A job runs twice a day; checks snoozed conversations && last note === yumi rep follow && snoozed time > 2 days
 send #what's up
 add note "followed up"
 snooze for 7 days
the same "job" checks snoozed conversations && last note = followed up && snooze time > 4 days
send #close
close the conversation


#Challenges
What if I want to cancel the process? 
 add a note or reply to a conversation
 since we're checking for snoozed conversations
 doing above will unsnooze them
What if I don't add a note and/or reply and snooze conversation again without adding yumi rep follow?
 good question. I don't know the answer to this question but I feel like doing so will still follow the process
 I'll have to check payload to see if you snooze a conversation after replying do we get the last note.
What if a user replies?
 if user or you reply the conversations will be opened nothing will happen if you don't snooze the conversation (until it's open)

 following use cases are for when you snooze conversation and/or reply/add a note 
 - you reply
   - no note added --> same as last question (not sure)
   - w/non followup note --> process will stop (note != yumi rep follow)
   - w/followup note --> new follow up process will start
 - you snooze the conversation 
   - no note added --> same as last question (not sure)
   - w/non followup note --> process will stop
   - w/followup note --> new follow up process will start
 - you add a note
   - follow up --> new follow up process will start
   - non follow up --> process will stop (note != yumi rep follow)

three basics actions 
process will stop
not sure
new process will start

things are clearer now
if you add a new note in any scenario two things will happen 
- if it's a non follow up note - process will stop
- if it's a follow up note - new process will start
what we're unsure is if you do an actions (reply/snooze) and don't add a note which means the last note for the conversation is still yumi rep follow. Will the process resume?


Test:
what payload do we get when finding all conversations





***********Approaches*************

#1
yumi rep follow
#what's up
snooze for a week
add ###
run close_convo.rb
to close it


#2 (Preferred)
yumi rep follow 

snooze for 3 days
after 2 days
#what's up 
note "followed up"
snooze for 7 days
after 4 days
#close

if preference change update command description


register follow command with getCommand in noteHandler
have a func -followUpConversation
maybe when yumi rep follow is called- call snoozeConversation for 3 days

when yumi rep follow is called
follow.go's followUpConversation will be called
