//Use .env

//Set sql query for where

//Use package sqlx

//put the code in a method and pass userId as parameter

//put values in a variable and not print them- already in a var using global now and printing from another func --> it took like what 20 secs to get this done. :D

//build notesBuilder method

//write a complex sql

//sql query fetching inspection in the last 30 days

//complete the noteBuilder method

//rename posturi variable

//iap query

//not fetching reports
- seems like it is ; more testing
- closing probably the bug which didn't let access files table. Isn't happening anymore

//Show inspection/report address instead of urls
- report done 
- inspection a bit cumbersome. May be later if required

//Make sense of variable names- reward underneath :)

//Due diligence - show 

//print --> log or something else
- no print statement in use

//Change query as per sqlx - go through https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx

//test queries:
- iap
- integration 
- buildium message 
- plan type

//Rather than running for loop for recs find a way to check for only for one value

//running twice
- might've something to do w/ngrok
- Michael T confirms to some extent will probably be sure after this review

//fetch inspections report from unarchived folders only
- we're; more testing or something

//modify play type query to check if any of the business is a Buildium/DD....

//exclude buildium support

//Solve a bug where B auto responder doesn't run when on a trial account too
